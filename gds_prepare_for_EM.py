    Flatten the hierarchy and remove isolated (floating) polygons that
    repeat with the same bounding-box size at least `mincount` times on a
    layer - this is the signature of auto-generated or man-made dummy
    metal fill. A same-size group with fewer than `mincount` members is
    left untouched even if isolated, since it's more likely to be
    deliberate design content than repetitive fill.

    IMPORTANT: run merge_polygons_by_layer() on `cell` before calling this.
    Isolation here means "touches nothing else at all", including a
    same-size neighbor - identical-size polygons that touch each other
    must not be deleted, since real connected metal (e.g. a Metal1/Metal2
    mesh or ground plane) is frequently built from many touching copies of
    the same unit tile too, same as dummy fill is. The only way to tell
    a genuinely floating cluster of touching same-size fill units apart
    from real connected metal made of the same-size tiles is to merge
    first: merging fuses every connected cluster (fill or real metal)
    into a single polygon, so a floating fill cluster becomes its own
    small isolated shape while a real connected network merges into one
    (or a few) large, usually uniquely-shaped/sized polygon(s) that won't
    match the same-size-repeat-count fill signature. Calling this on
    unmerged geometry is exactly what caused whole real metal layers to
    be wiped out in an earlier version - don't skip the merge step.

    Gating on repeat count (rather than a fixed absolute size ceiling)
    generalizes across layers/layouts automatically: a size that
    legitimately repeats often enough is treated as fill regardless of
    its absolute micron size, and groups below mincount are skipped
    before running the (relatively expensive) isolation test at all -
    so a large one-off shape, which can never reach mincount, is never
    tested. `maxsize` remains available as an optional manual cap for
    cases where you want to exclude large sizes outright regardless of
    repeat count; leave it as None to rely on mincount alone (the
    default, and the recommended setting for most layouts).

    Only considers polygons on the same layer for isolation.

  Replace a via array with clean, low-vertex solid via-region shapes.

  Rather than growing/merging/shrinking via shapes by a manually chosen
  spacing (which traces a jagged boundary around the individual via
  positions), this groups the vias by which metal-above polygon and which
  metal-below polygon each one actually lands in. For every (above, below)
  polygon pair that has at least one real via connecting them, it outputs
  the overlap of three things: that specific metal-above polygon, that
  specific metal-below polygon, AND the convex hull of the actual via
  positions in that group.

  The via-position hull matters: metal-above and metal-below can overlap
  over a much bigger area than the (possibly sparse, even a single via)
  cluster that actually connects them there - e.g. two wide routing
  strips that cross and are joined by one via. Clipping only to the
  above/below overlap would fill that whole crossing area with via
  material, wildly overstating the real via footprint. Intersecting with
  the via-position hull as well keeps the result close to where vias
  actually are.

  This directly satisfies most of the properties we want, with no manual
  distance parameter:
  - the merge is naturally capped at "as large as the metal above and
    below actually allow, and no bigger than where vias really are".
  - vias belonging to different metal-above or metal-below polygons are
    never merged together: distinct (above, below) pairs always produce
    separate output shapes, so a merged via region can never bridge two
    unrelated metal shapes.

  A convex hull is NOT always low-vertex, though: that's only true for a
  roughly rectangular via grid (hull = its 4-8 corners). A via array
  arranged to fill a disk/circular footprint (matching a round pad above
  it) has most of its via positions sitting on the hull, so the hull
  traces a jagged staircase approximation of the circle - dozens to
  hundreds of vertices, confirmed on a real 598-via cluster. Simplifying
  the hull (Douglas-Peucker, tolerance scaled to the cluster's own size)
  fixes this while barely changing its area, and offset-based
  grow/merge/shrink smoothing was tried and does not converge to a clean
  shape here even at offsets far larger than the cluster itself.
