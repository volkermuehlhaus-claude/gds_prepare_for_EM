# Shared geometry utilities for GDSII layout simplification.
# Used by gds_simplify.py and gds_prepare_for_EM.py.
#
# Covers three generalized simplification steps:
# - decompose_polygon_holes: resolve a polygon-with-hole (GDSII's
#   self-intersecting "bridge" encoding) into exterior + interior rings,
#   for any hole shape/count/rotation - not just an axis-aligned square
#   with a centered square hole.
# - is_circle_like / kasa_circle_fit / simplify_round_polygon_to_octagon:
#   detect near-circular polygons via isoperimetric circularity and fit
#   them with a proper least-squares circle instead of centroid+mean-radius.
# - detect_and_delete_periphery_rings: find thin ring/frame structures
#   near a design's outer boundary (e.g. seal rings), which are commonly
#   built as a hierarchy of segment cells rather than a single polygon
#   with a hole, and delete their geometry.

def decompose_polygon_holes(points, min_hole_area=1e-6):
    """
    Resolve a GDSII polygon that may encode a hole via a self-intersecting
    'bridge' edge (outer boundary -> bridge -> inner boundary reversed ->
    bridge back) into a clean exterior ring plus interior hole ring(s).

    min_hole_area is an absolute area threshold (design units squared),
    not a fraction of the exterior area: real density-rule cutout holes
    are often a tiny fraction of the fill polygon's area (e.g. a 0.5x0.5
    hole in a 20x20 fill square is 0.06% of the area), so a fractional
    threshold would reject exactly the cutouts we want to catch. The
    default here only filters out true numerical-noise artifacts.
